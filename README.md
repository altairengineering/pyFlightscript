## pyFlightscript
!Compatible with FlightStream 2025.0 and later.

A python API for generating native FlightStream scripts.
This is an open source project, but is sponsored in part by Research In Flight. Development is on-going.

pyFlightscript contains all of the traditional scripting functions found in FlightStream. The functions are nested within
submodules categorized by function. for example `pyFlighscript.solver.initialize_solver() `

## Installation

Install dependencies. 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Simply download the repo and install with within the directory:

`pip install .`

## Features

- Generates FlightStream scripts with a user-friendly Pythonic interface
- Modules broken into categories for ease of search.

## Example code

See example code folder for more detailed examples.
The general flow for a pyFlightscript based script is:

```
   import pyFlightscript as pyfs

   fsexe_path = r'C:\filepath\FlightStream.exe' #specify file path to FS exe
   pyfs.script.hard_reset() # (optional) clear lines from local memory, delete existing script.txt

    ### Enter FlightStream macro commands ###
    ### Example code ####
    pyfs.fsinit.open_fsm(fsm_filepath=f)
    pyfs.exec_solver.close_flightstream
    ################################

    # all macro commands done
    pyfs.script.write_to_file() # now write script_out.txt
    pyfs.execute_fsm_script(fsexe_path=fsexe_path, hidden=True) # execute the script in headless FS
    pyfs.script.display_lines()
    pyfs.script.hard_reset()  # clear the lines from local memory and delete the script.txt file

```
